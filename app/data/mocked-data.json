        "full_article": "A comprehensive study conducted by a team of international researchers has shed light on the key factors that contribute to longevity. The research focused on populations in 'Blue Zones,' regions where people tend to live significantly longer than average. The study found that regular physical activity, plant-based diets, strong social connections, and stress management are common traits among the longest-living individuals. Additionally, these populations have low rates of chronic diseases, such as heart disease and cancer. The findings suggest that making small, sustainable lifestyle changes could add years to your life and improve overall well-being."
